# This is a Xcodegen project setup file for running locally (for example, when switching branches)
# If differs from the CI-based script in that it runs `bundle exec pod install` command after
# building the project. This is required for local development.
#
# A post-checkout Github build hook should run this automatically but if you are facing problems,
# you can simply `git checkout` to force this to run. Note that this will use the cache so if there
# are no changes to the project, nothing will happen.
#
# In dire cases, if you want to ignore the cache for debugging, ensure you are in the root directory 
# of the repository and run:
# `xcodegen --spec ./eSageApp/project_local.yml --project ./eSageApp`
